## Project: BudgetBuddy

**BudgetBuddy** is a product for users who wish to handle and track any current/future expenses on a singular platform.
BudgetBuddy provides a faster and more efficient way to track and calculate expenses and provides the ability
to deal with finances on a singular platform with ease as long as you can type fast.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Features

#### Listing Saving/Expense Feature
- **What it does**: Displays a list of all savings/expenses inputted by the user. Allows the user to view expenses/savings spent/earned so far based on his/her inputs. Also allows user to view remaining amount left in savings after deducting expenses.
- **Justification**: This is a basic essential feature surrounding the core functionality of our product. 
- **Highlights**: The in-built calculation of remaining savings provides easy accessibility to information without the need for external calculation devices.

#### Currency Converter Feature
- **What it does**: Converts currently listed and future expenses/savings into another currency of choice listed in the User Guide. This feature ties in with my Listing feature to view the currency changes.
- **Justification**: This feature is greatly beneficial for users who travel frequently and often stay in foreign countries for a period of time. It allows them to track their expenses/savings regardless of their location. Additionally, one can also check how much their savings are worth if they plan to travel to another country in the future.
- **Highlights**: The user is able to convert interchangeably between the countries listed, providing greater convenience.
