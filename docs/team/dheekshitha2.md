## Project: BudgetBuddy
BudgetBuddy is a product for users who wish to handle and track any current/future expenses on a singular platform.
BudgetBuddy provides a faster and more efficient way to track and calculate expenses and provides the ability to deal
with finances on a singular platform with ease. It has multiple financial tracking options to suit your needs.

## Summary of Contributions
My primary contributions include developing the budget setting functions, and enabling users to delete their expenses
or reduce their savings, thereby improving the app's usability and user experience.

### New Feature: Added the ability to set and manage budget
- **What it does:** Allows users to set and adjust budgets for various categories such as groceries, transport, and
  housing. Users can define a maximum spending limit for each category, which helps in monitoring and controlling
  their expenditures.
- **Justification:** This feature is pivotal for users aiming to adhere to their financial goals, and ensure that they
  do not overspend in any category
- **Highlights:** Implementing this feature requires a deep understanding of the app's different functions and how they
  all work together. One challenge of implementing this feature was integrating existing functions like `Expenses` so that
  I am able to retrieve the relevant expense information to check if the user is still within their budget.
