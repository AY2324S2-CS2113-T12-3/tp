## Edit Expenses
### Implementation

The Edit Expense feature allows users to edit their previously added expenses, specifically the `category`, `amount`, 
and `description`. This feature is managed by the `EditExpenseCommand` class, which is initialized by the 
`Parser` class. Within the `EditExpenseCommand` object, 5 variables would have been initialized in the `Parser` class:
an `ExpenseList` object, `category`, `index`, `amount` and `description`. The relevance of these Class Attributes in 
`EditExpenseCommand` is as follows:

| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expenses        | ExpenseList   | ExpenseList Object containing the list of expenses that can be edited |
| category        | String        | The edited category for the expense in the spciefied index            |
| index           | Integer       | The index of the expense to be edited from `ExpenseList`              |
| amount          | Double        | The edited amount the expense in the specified index should be        |
| description     | String        | The edited description for the expense in the specified index         |

When the `execute()` method in `BudgetBuddy` is called via `command.execute()`, the `EditExpenseCommand` Object, 
utilizes the following method from the `ExpenseList` class to edit the expense.

| Method        | Return Type | Relevance                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| editExpense() | void        | Edits the `category`, `amount` and `description` for the expense in the specified `index` |

The following UML Sequence diagram below shows how the Edit Expense Feature Command is executed when a user
inputs a valid edit expense command:

The following is a step by step explanation of the processes that occur for an example input:
`edit expense c/Transport i/2 a/40 d/GRAB`

1. The BudgetBuddy application receives the input string `edit expense c/Transport i/2 a/40 d/GRAB` and uses 
the `Parser` to interpret it.
2. The `Parser` splits the input into parts and constructs a `EditExpenseCommand` Object with the category 
(`c/Transport`), index (`i/2`), 
amount (`a/40`), and description (`d/GRAB`).
3. `Parser` returns this called `EditExpenseCommand` Object to `BudgetBuddy`.
4. The `BudgetBuddy` application calls `execute()` on the `EditExpenseCommand` object.
5. The `EditExpenseCommand` object calls `editExpense` on the `ExpenseList` with the provided parameters. 
6. The `ExpenseList` looks up the second expense in its list 
(as lists are zero-indexed, it uses index - 1 to access the correct item), and updates this expenseâ€™s 
category to "Transport," amount to 40.0, and description to "GRAB."
7. A message "Expense edited successfully." is printed to the console.
