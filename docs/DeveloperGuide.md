### Budget Management

#### Implementation
The Budget Management feature allows users to set financial limits for the various categories and monitor their spending. 
This feature's objective is to give users the ability to stay within their financial goals and avoid overspending.

This feature is orchestrated by `ListBudgetCommand` and `SetBudgetCommand`, which are initialised by the `Parser` 
class. Below is a description of the key class attributes and methods involved in the budget setting and listing 
process:

##### Class Attributes for `SetBudgetCommand`:
| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                           |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expenseList     | ExpenseList   | Object containing the list of expenses to check against set budgets |
| category        | String        | The category for which the budget is being set                      |
| budget          | double        | The budget amount to be set for the category                        |

##### Class Attributes for `ListBudgetCommand`:
| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                           |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expenseList     | ExpenseList   | Object containing the list of expenses to check against set budgets |


Upon the call of the `execute()` method in `BudgetBuddy` using `command.execute()`, `SetBudgetCommand` will update the 
budget in `ExpenseList` using `setBudget`. Similarly, `ListBudgetCommand` will fetch and display all categories with 
their budgets using `getBudgets`, and highlight those that are above the set budget.

##### Key Methods used from `ExpenseList`
| Method                      | Return Type   | Relevance                                                          |
|-----------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| setBudget(category, budget) | void          | Sets or updates the budget for a given category in the ExpenseList |
| getBudgets()                | List<Budget>  | Retrieves the list of all budgets set                              |

#### Examples of usage

1. The user types `set budget c/food b/500` to set a budget of $500 for the food category. The Parser class creates a 
`SetBudgetCommand` object which calls `setBudget()` on the `ExpenseList` object.
2. To view budgets, the user enters `budget print`. The Parser class creates a `ListBudgetCommand` object. This command 
retrieves the budgets using `getBudgets()` and displays them, also indicating any categories that are over budget.

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Developer Guide for BudgetBuddy! This guide has been created to help you current and future 
developers of Budget understand how BudgetBuddy works and aid developers in easily adding new features, 
fix bugs. In this guide, it will go over the main parts of the app, how they work together, 
and why we made them that way.

## 2. Setup Guide
This section describes how to set up the coding environment, along with the tools needed to work on BudgetBuddy

### 2.1. Prerequisites
1. JDK 11
2. IntelliJ IDEA

## 3.Design

### 3.1 Architecture
The following diagram provides a rough overview of how BudgetBuddy is built

![Diagram of overview of BudgetBuddy](diagrams/Introduction.jpg)

`BudgetBuddy` is the main class of the application and directly interacts with the user, passing along the input
into the Parser. The `Parser` creates a `CommandCreator` object depending on the user's input. The `CommandCreator`
object then creates the `Command` object. This `Command` will be executed in `BudgetBuddy`. The `Command` object 
utilizes methods and the class present in the `Application Classes`, which will be explained in more 
detail in the following sections.

#### 3.2 Parser Class
The main functionality of the Parser Class is to determine the type of `CommandCreator` object to initialize, and
return the created `Command` object created by the `CommandCreator` back to `BudgetBuddy`

#### 3.3 Ui Class
The Ui Class is used to print certain elements to the CLI. In particular, it consists of the Welcome Message,
Goodbye Message, Divider Lines and all the corresponding commands' command format.

#### 3.5 CommandCreator Class
The CommandCreator class contains multiple subclasses, which corresponding to a specific function of the application.
Within the CommandCreator classes, it handles making sense of the user input, obtaining the relevant parameters to be
used in the created `Command` class.

#### 3.4 Command Class
The Command class, similar to the CommandCreator class, contains multiple subclasses, all corresponding to a specific
function of the application. In this case, each CommandCreator class would be associated to their relevant Commands.
Here is a table of all CommandCreator class and the Commands that they can create.

#### 3.5 Storage Class
The Storage Class handles the loading and saving of the Expenses and Savings in BudgetBuddy.
It also saves and loads the default currency being used by the user.

### 3.6 Application Classes
The classes present in this group of `Application Classes` refers to certain elements which serves a purpose more
towards the `user` instead of application itself. They represent data of the user's financial transactions,
including expenses and savings, along with mechanisms for organizing and managing this data in meaningful ways.

##### 3.6.1 Transaction
This is an abstract class, which is the superclass for both the Expense and Saving Classes. It contains common variables
such as Currency, Category and Amount.

##### 3.6.2 Expense
This class holds details regarding an expense a user has. Within this class, it has 4 class-level variables :
`String category`, `LocalDate dateAdded` , `String description` and `Double amount`. The variables and their relevance
are as follows : 

`String category` : This variable holds the category of the expense. It represents the type or classification 
of the expense as per the pre-defined categories ("Housing", "Groceries", "Utility", "Transport", "Entertainment").

`LocalDate dateAdded` : This variable holds the date when the expense was added or recorded. 
It is of type LocalDate, representing a date without a time zone. 
Storing the date of the expense allows users to track when each expense occurred, 
facilitating budget management and analysis over time.

`String description` : This variable holds a description of the expense. 
It provides additional details or information about the expense, 
such as what the expense was for or any relevant notes. 
Descriptions help users understand the context or purpose of each expense entry.

`Double amount` :  This variable holds the monetary amount of the expense. 
It represents the cost or value of the expense, typically in the currency used by the user. 
Storing the amount allows users to track how much money was spent on each expense, 
aiding in budgeting and financial planning.

##### 3.6.3 ExpenseList
This class represents a list of expenses. Within this class, it has 2 class-level variables :
`ArrayList<Expense> expenses` and `ArrayList<String> categories`, The variables and there relevance are as follows :

`ArrayList<Expense> expenses` : This variable holds a list of `Expense` objects. 
Each `Expense` object represents an expense incurred by the user. The list stores all the expenses entered by the user. 
Managing expenses in a list allows for easy retrieval, modification, and deletion of individual expenses. 
Additionally, it enables functionalities such as filtering, listing, and calculating total expenses.

`ArrayList<String> categories` : This variable holds a list of predefined expense categories. 
Each category represents a classification or grouping for expenses, such as "Housing," "Groceries," "Utility," etc. 
The list provides predefined options for users to select when adding or editing expenses. 
It helps organize expenses into meaningful groups, 
allowing users to track and analyze their spending habits across different expense categories.

This class also contains the methods to handle any user interactions with the list of expenses. The methods and a
brief explanation on their functionality is as follows :

* listExpenses(String filterCategory) :
  * The core functionality of this class. It lists a user's total expenses, optionally filtered by category as per user
  input.
  * The amounts being shown are dependent on the currency being used.
* calculateTotalExpenses() :
  * The method used to calculate all expenses found in the expense list.

##### 3.6.4 Saving
This class holds details regarding a saving a user has. Within this class, it has 3 class-level variables :
`String category`, `LocalDate dateAdded`, `Double amount`. The variables and their relevance
are as follows :

`String Category` : This variable holds the category of the saving. 
Similar to expenses, savings can also be categorized based on their purpose or intended use. 
Pre-defined categories include ("Salary", "Investments", "Gifts", or "Others"). 
Categorizing savings helps users allocate funds for different financial goals and track progress towards those goals.

`LocalDate dateAdded` : This variable holds the date when the saving was added or recorded. 
As with expenses, tracking the date of each saving allows users to monitor their saving habits over time. 
It provides a historical record of when savings were initiated, 
helping users understand their saving patterns and behaviors.

`Double amount` : This variable holds the monetary amount of the saving. 
It represents the value or sum of money saved by the user. 
The amount indicates how much money has been set aside or accumulated towards achieving a particular financial goal. 
Users can track their progress towards savings targets and 
monitor their overall financial health based on the amount saved.

##### 3.6.5 SavingList
This class represents a list of savings. Within this class, it has 2 class-level variables :
`ArrayList<Saving> savings` and `ArrayList<String> categories`, The variables and there relevance are as follows :

`ArrayList<Saving> savings`: This variable holds a list of `Saving` objects, 
where each object represents a saving made by the user. The list stores all the savings entered by the user. 
Managing savings in a list allows for easy retrieval, modification, and reduction of individual savings. 
Additionally, it enables functionalities such as listing savings, calculating remaining savings after 
deducting expenses, and adding new savings.

`ArrayList<String> categories`: This variable holds a list of predefined saving categories. 
Each category represents a classification or grouping for savings, such as "Salary," "Investments," "Gifts," etc. 
The list provides predefined options for users to select when adding or editing savings. 
It helps organize savings into meaningful groups, allowing users to track and 
manage their savings across different categories.

This class also contains the methods to handle any user interactions with the list of savings. The methods and a
brief explanation on their functionality is as follows :

* `listSavings(String filterCategory, ExpenseList expenseList)` :
  * The core functionality of this class. It prints the initial savings amount, expenses deducted, and the remaining 
  amount. 
  * It is able to print only the filtered category as per user input.
  * The amounts being shown is dependent on the currency being used.
* `findTotalSavings()` :
  * Calculates the total savings amount by summing up the amounts of all savings.
* `calculateRemainingSavings(double initialAmount, double totalExpenses)` :
  * Calculates the remaining savings amount after deducting total expenses from the initial amount.
  * Provides clarity on how much savings user has left to spend.

##### 3.6.6 RecurringExpenseList
Explain what it does

##### 3.6.7 RecurringExpensesList
Explain what it does

##### 3.6.8 DefaultCurrency

##### 3.6.9 CurrencyConverter
The `CurrencyConverter` class provides functionality for converting amounts between different currencies. It includes two class-level variables:

`Map<Currency, Double> exchangeRates`: This variable represents a map where the keys are instances of 
the `Currency` class, and the values are conversion rates as `Double` values. 
The map stores exchange rates for various currencies relative to a base currency (in this case, Singapore Dollar, SGD). 
The exchange rates are initialized with default values for common currencies such as 
USD, EUR, JPY, KRW, MYR, CNY, and HKD.

The class includes several methods to handle currency conversion tasks:

* `convertAmount(double amount, Currency fromCurrency, Currency toCurrency)`: 
This method converts an amount from one currency to another using exchange rates stored in the `exchangeRates` map. 
It takes the original amount, the currency of the original amount (`fromCurrency`), 
and the target currency (`toCurrency`) as parameters and returns the converted amount. 
The method ensures that exchange rates are available for both currencies and that they are positive numbers.

* `convertExpenseCurrency(Currency newCurrency, ExpenseList expenses)`: 
This method converts the currency of expenses in a given `ExpenseList` to a specified new currency (`newCurrency`). 
It iterates through the expenses in the list, converts each expense amount to the new currency 
using the `convertAmount` method, and updates the expense amounts and currencies accordingly.

* `convertSavingCurrency(Currency newCurrency, SavingList savings)`: Similar to `convertExpenseCurrency`, 
this method converts the currency of savings in a given `SavingList` to a specified new currency (`newCurrency`). 
It iterates through the savings in the list, converts each saving amount to the new currency using the `convertAmount` 
method, and updates the saving amounts and currencies accordingly.

These methods facilitate currency conversion tasks by handling the conversion logic, validating input parameters, 
and logging relevant messages. They provide essential functionality for managing expenses and savings in different 
currencies within the budget management application.


## 4. Implementation

### Edit Expense Feature
The Edit Expense feature allows users to edit their previously added expenses, specifically the `category`, `amount`, 
and `description`. This feature is managed by the `EditExpenseCommand` class, which is initialized by the 
`Parser` class. Within the `EditExpenseCommand` object, 5 variables would have been initialized in the `Parser` class:
an `ExpenseList` object, `category`, `index`, `amount` and `description`. The relevance of these Class Attributes in 
`EditExpenseCommand` is as follows:

| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expenses        | ExpenseList   | ExpenseList Object containing the list of expenses that can be edited |
| category        | String        | The edited category for the expense in the specified index            |
| index           | Integer       | The index of the expense to be edited from `ExpenseList`              |
| amount          | Double        | The edited amount the expense in the specified index should be        |
| description     | String        | The edited description for the expense in the specified index         |

When the `execute()` method in `BudgetBuddy` is called via `command.execute()`, the `EditExpenseCommand` Object, 
utilizes the following method from the `ExpenseList` class to edit the expense.

| Method        | Return Type | Relevance                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| editExpense() | void        | Edits the `category`, `amount` and `description` for the expense in the specified `index` |

The following UML Sequence diagram below shows how the Edit Expense Feature Command is executed when a user
inputs a valid edit expense command:

![EditExpenseSequence.png](team/EditExpenseSequence.png)

The following is a step by step explanation of the processes that occur for an example input:
`edit expense c/Transport i/2 a/40 d/GRAB`

1. The BudgetBuddy application receives the input string `edit expense c/Transport i/2 a/40 d/GRAB` and uses 
the `Parser` to interpret it.
2. The `Parser` splits the input into parts and constructs a `EditExpenseCommand` Object with the category 
(`c/Transport`), index (`i/2`), 
amount (`a/40`), and description (`d/GRAB`).
3. `Parser` returns this called `EditExpenseCommand` Object to `BudgetBuddy`.
4. The `BudgetBuddy` application calls `execute()` on the `EditExpenseCommand` object.
5. The `EditExpenseCommand` object calls `editExpense` on the `ExpenseList` with the provided parameters. 
6. The `ExpenseList` looks up the second expense in its list 
(as lists are zero-indexed, it uses index - 1 to access the correct item), and updates this expense’s 
category to "Transport," amount to 40.0, and description to "GRAB."
7. A message "Expense edited successfully." is printed to the console.


### Listing Feature (List Savings)

The Listing Savings Feature enables users to view their savings, potentially filtered by a specific category. This functionality is orchestrated by the `ListSavingsCommand` class, which is initialized by the `ListCommandCreator` class. Within the `ListSavingsCommand` object, the `ListCommandCreator` provides it with a `SavingList` object, an `ExpenseList` object, along with an optional `filterCategory`. The relevance of these class attributes in `ListSavingsCommand` is detailed in the following table:

| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                                           |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| savings         | SavingList    | The `SavingList` object containing the list of savings to be displayed or filtered |
| expenses        | ExpenseList   | The `ExpenseList` object containing the list of expenses                            |
| filterCategory  | String        | The category to filter the savings by, if provided                                  |

When `BudgetBuddy` invokes the `execute()` method via `command.execute()`, the `ListSavingsCommand` object uses several methods from the `SavingList` class to perform its tasks:

| Method                      | Return Type        | Relevance                                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| getSavings()                | ArrayList<Saving>  | Retrieves the list of all savings from the `SavingList`        |
| findTotalSavings()          | void               | Calculates the total amount of savings stored in `SavingList`  |
| listSavings()               | void               | Prints the savings, filtered by `filterCategory`, to the CLI   |
| calculateRemainingSavings() | double             | Calculates the remaining amount after deducting total expenses |

The Listing Savings feature follows these steps when a user inputs a command to list savings:
1. The user inputs `list savings [optional: filterCategory]`. This input is processed by the `Parser` class in `BudgetBuddy`, which creates a `ListSavingsCommand` object with `savings` set to the current `SavingList` and `filterCategory` to the user-specified category, if any.
2. The `Parser` returns this `ListSavingsCommand` object to `BudgetBuddy`, which calls `ListSavingsCommand.execute()`.
3. `execute()` calls `SavingList.listSavings(filterCategory, expenses)`, where the `filterCategory` is applied if provided.
4. Within `listSavings()`, the `findTotalSavings()` method is called first to calculate the initial total savings amount.
5. The `listSavings()` method continues by iterating through each `Saving` and printing those that match the `filterCategory` criteria.
6. After listing, the method calculates and displays the remaining savings by calling `calculateRemainingSavings(initialAmount, totalExpenses)`, accounting for any expenses deducted.
7. If the `filterCategory` is not provided, all savings are printed, and the total initial amount and remaining savings after expenses are displayed.

#### Sequence Diagram
The UML Sequence diagram for the Listing Savings feature would illustrate the interactions between the `User`, `BudgetBuddy`, `Parser`, `ListSavingsCommand`, and `SavingList` classes, showing the method calls and returns between these objects to complete the operation.
![Sequence diagram for List Expense Feature](diagrams/SavingList_SequenceDiagram.png)

### Listing feature (List Expenses)
The Listing Expenses Feature provides users with the ability to view their expenses, which can be filtered by category. The `ListExpenseCommand` class, generated by the `ListCommandCreator`, is responsible for this feature. The class utilizes the `ExpenseList` object to access and manipulate expense records, optionally applying a filter based on the category. The significance of the `ListExpenseCommand` class's attributes is outlined below:

| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expenses        | ExpenseList   | Holds the list of expenses to be filtered and listed                              |
| filterCategory  | String        | The category to filter the expenses by (null if no filtering is needed)           |

Upon invoking the `execute()` method by `BudgetBuddy` through `command.execute()`, the `ListExpenseCommand` object calls upon several methods from the `ExpenseList` class to carry out its responsibilities:

| Method                   | Return Type | Relevance                                                              |
|--------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| listExpenses()           | void        | Prints the expenses, filtered by `filterCategory`, to the command line |
| calculateTotalExpenses() | double      | Calculates the total expenses from the list of expenses                |

Here's an overview of the process flow when a user employs the Listing Expenses feature:
1. The user types `list expenses [optional: filterCategory]`. This command is parsed by the `Parser` class within `BudgetBuddy`, which then creates a `ListExpenseCommand` with `expenses` set to the current `ExpenseList` and `filterCategory` set to any specified by the user.
2. The `Parser` returns the `ListExpenseCommand` object to `BudgetBuddy`, which calls `ListExpenseCommand.execute()`.
3. The `execute()` method invokes `ExpenseList.listExpenses(filterCategory)`. If a `filterCategory` is provided, it will filter the expenses accordingly.
4. The `listExpenses()` method in `ExpenseList` iterates over the list of expenses and prints each one that matches the filter category criteria or all expenses if no filter is provided.
5. The method concludes by displaying the total expenses calculated using `calculateTotalExpenses()`.

#### Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram for the Listing Expenses feature would illustrate the above steps, showing the interactions between the `User`, `BudgetBuddy`, `Parser`, `ListExpensesCommand`, and `ExpenseList` classes.
![Sequence diagram for List Expense Feature](diagrams/ExpenseList_SequenceDiagram.png)


### Currency Converter feature
The Currency Converter Feature allows users to convert the currency of expenses and savings. This feature is facilitated by the `ChangeCurrencyCommand` class, initialized by the `Parser` class with `CurrencyConverter`, `ExpenseList`, and `SavingList` objects, alongside the `newCurrency` to convert to. The importance of these class attributes is as follows:

| Class Attribute   | Variable Type          | Relevance                                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| currencyConverter | CurrencyConverter      | The object responsible for currency conversion calculations |
| expenseList       | ExpenseList            | Contains the expenses whose currency will be converted      |
| savingList        | SavingList             | Contains the savings whose currency will be converted       |
| newCurrency       | Currency               | The new currency to which the amounts will be converted     | 
| exchangeRates     | Map<Currency, Double>  | Stores exchange rates with currencies as keys               |

When `BudgetBuddy` calls `command.execute()`, `ChangeCurrencyCommand` employs the following methods from `CurrencyConverter` to convert the currency of all financial records:

| Method                   | Return Type | Relevance                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| convertExpenseCurrency() | void        | Converts the currency of each `Expense` object to `newCurrency`           |
| convertSavingCurrency()  | void        | Converts the currency of each `Saving` object to `newCurrency`            |
| convertAmount()          | double      | Converts an amount from one currency to another using the exchange rates  |

The Currency Converter feature also includes a mechanism for managing a default currency across the application, facilitated by the `DefaultCurrency` class. This enhancement allows for seamless conversion of financial records to a user-specified default currency.

The `DefaultCurrency` class is designed to maintain and update the application-wide default currency setting. It provides static methods to get and set the default currency:

| Method               | Return Type | Relevance                                                    |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| getDefaultCurrency   | Currency    | Retrieves the current default currency for the application   |
| setDefaultCurrency   | void        | Updates the default currency to a new value                  |


Here's the step-by-step process when the user uses the Currency Converter feature:
1. The user inputs `change currency [newCurrencyCode]`. `Parser` processes this input and constructs a `ChangeCurrencyCommand` object with the necessary attributes.
2. The `ChangeCurrencyCommand` object is returned to `BudgetBuddy`, which calls `ChangeCurrencyCommand.execute()`.
3. `execute()` invokes `CurrencyConverter.convertExpenseCurrency(newCurrency, expenseList)` and `CurrencyConverter.convertSavingCurrency(newCurrency, savingList)`.
4. Within the `convertExpenseCurrency` and `convertSavingCurrency` call, the amounts of `Expense` or `Saving` objects are converted to the `newCurrency` using the `convertAmount` method.
5. The `DefaultCurrency.setDefaultCurrency(newCurrency)` method is called to update the application's default currency setting to `newCurrency`.
6. The `setAmount` and `setCurrency` methods of `ExpenseList` and `SavingList` are used to update the amounts and currency codes.
7. After successful conversion of savings and expenses, the default currency of the application is updated, reflecting the new choice across BudgetBuddy.

### Menu Feature
  
The menu feature is designed to allow users to view the relevant command formats by inputting the relevant menu
indexes. This feature is orchestrated by the `MenuCommand` class, which is initialized by the `MenuCommandCreator` 
class. Which is in turn, created by the `Parser` class. Within the `MenuCommand` object, the 
`MenuCommandCreator` would initialize one class-level variable `index` of type `String`. The relevance of
this class-level variable in `MenuCommand` is as follows

| Variable Name | Variable Type | Relevance                                              |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| index         | int           | Refers to the corresponding item in the displayed menu |

For Clarity, the menu items and their corresponding indexes are as follows :

| index | Menu Item               |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Empty | Displays all Menu Items |
| 1     | Manage Expenses         |
| 2     | Manage Savings          |
| 3     | View Expenses           |
| 4     | View Savings            |
| 5     | Find Expenses           |

Upon the call of the `execute()` method in BudgetBuddy using `command.execute()`, the `MenuCommand` object
utilizes methods from the `UI` class to display the relevant menu items. The utilized methods are as follows :

| methodName          | Return Type | Relevance                           |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| showMenuTitles()    | void        | Prints all Menu Items               |
| showMenuItem(INDEX) | void        | Prints commands associated at INDEX |

The following UML Sequence Diagram shows how the MenuCommandCreator for Menu Commands work, NOTING that the Parser
has already detected that the user input is a menu command and has initialized a MenuCommandCreator object:
![Sequence Diagram for MenuCommandCreator for Menu Command](diagrams/sequenceDiagram-MenuCommandCreator.jpg)

The following UML Sequence Diagram shows how the overall Menu feature works :
![Sequence Diagram for Menu Command](diagrams/sequenceDiagram_MenuFeature.jpg)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the full Menu feature works :
1. The user types `menu 1`. This input passed from `BudgetBuddy` into `Parser#parseCommands()`.
2. Within the `Parser` , it determines that the input is a menu command from `isMenuCommand()`, and creates a new
`MenuCommandCreator` object.
3. The `Parser` then calls `MenuCommandCreator#createCommand()`
4. The checks for whether the input is valid, in particular whether it is a valid integer, 
along with obtaining the value of `index` is done in `MenuCommandCreator#handleMenuCommand`
5. `MenuCommandCreator` creates a constructor for `MenuCommand` with the parameter `1`, which in turn 
also constructs a new `Ui` object
6. `MenuCommandCreator` returns this created `MenuCommand` to `Parser`, which is then returned to `BudgetBuddy`
7. `BudgetBuddy` then calls `MenuCommand#execute()`
8. `execute()` then calls `Ui#showMenuItem(1)`
9. `showMenuItem()` in `Ui` then prints all commands for `case 1` which is for `Manage Expenses`

  
### Find Feature

The Find Feature allows users to search for expenses based on a specific criteria such as description, minimum amount
and maximum amount. This feature is orchestrated by the `FindExpensesCommand` class, which is created by the `FindExpensesCommandCreator`
, which is in turn created by the `Parser`. Within the `FindExpensesCommand` object, the `FindExpensesCommandCreator` 
would have initialized it with 4 variables, an `ExpenseList` object,  along with a `description`, `minAmount` , 
`maxAmount`. The relevance of these Class Attributes in `FindExpensesCommand` is as follows : 

| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expenses        | ExpenseList   | ExpenseList Object containing the list of expenses which will be filtered |
| description     | String        | The description to match against expenses in `expenses`                   |
| minAmount       | Double        | The minimum amount matched expenses should be                             |
| maxAmount       | Double        | The **maximum** amount matched expenses should be                         |


Upon the call of the `execute()` method in `BudgetBuddy` using `command.execute()`,
the `FindExpensesCommand` Object, utilizes the following methods from the `ExpenseList` class in order to both 
obtain a new `ExpenseList` object containing the filtered expenses, along with printing them.

| Method           | Return Type        | Relevance                                                       |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| filterExpenses() | ArrayList<Expense> | Returns an ArrayList<Expense> containing all filtered expenses  |
| listExpenses()   | void               | Prints the filtered expenses obtained from `filterExpenses()`   |

The following UML Sequence diagram below shows how FindExpensesCommandCreator works to 
obtain the relevant inputs for the Find Feature, NOTING that the Parser has already determined the input to be a find :
expenses command, and has also created the FindExpensesCommandCreator.
![Sequence Diagram for Parser for Find Feature](diagrams/sequenceDiagram-Parser%20For%20Find%20Command.jpg)

The following is a step-by-step explanation for the processes that occur before the FindExpensesCommand is created :
1. `BudgetBuddy` calls `Parser#parseCommand(input)` with `input` being the entire user input.
E.g `find expenses d/bruno`
2. Within the `Parser`, it will have determined that the `input` is a Find Command from the `isFindCommand(input)`.
3. The `Parser` then creates a `FindExpensesCommandCreator` object, initializing it with the overall Expense List and
the provided user input
4. The `Parser` then calls `FindExpensesCommandCreator#createCommand()`.
5. `FindExpensesCommandCreator#createCommand()` then calls `FindExpensesCommandCreator#handleFindExpensesCommand()`
6. Within `handleFindExpensesCommand(input)`, the first check would be the check for the existence of any combination of 
`d/ , morethan/ and lessthan/`. If none of these combinations were found, it immediately returns `null`
7. This is then followed by a second check `checkForDuplicateParameters()`, which checks for duplicates of parameters
in the user input. It duplicates are found, similarly, it immediately returns `null`.
8. If the checks in `4.` and `5` is passed, Three variables would be initialized.

    * | Variable Name | Variable Type |                                                              
      |---------------|---------------|
      | description   | String        | 
      | minAmount     | Double        |
      | maxAmount     | Double        |
9. Depending on which parameters were present, the corresponding input would be extracted and placed into each variable
using the `FindExpensesCommandCreator#parse*()`, where `*` represents the variable name we wish to obtain.
10. Should the values of `minAmount` and `maxAmount` not be empty,  a check is done to ensure `minAmount` is less than
or equals to `maxAmount`. If this check does not pass, the function immediately returns `null`
11. Finally, `FindExpensesCommandCreator#handleFindExpensesCommand()` creates and returns a 
`FindExpensesCommand` containing the extracted description, minAmount and maxAmount
12. `FindExpensesCommandCreator#createCommand()`, which is returned to, `Parser#parseCommand()`
, which is then returned to `BudgetBuddy`

The following UML Sequence diagram below shows how the Find Feature command works when a user provides a **valid**
find expenses command:

![Sequence diagram for Find Feature](diagrams/SequenceDiagram_FindExpenses.jpg)

The following is an example of the processes that occur when the user uses the find expenses feature:


**Important Note** : Although d/ , morethan/ and lessthan/ are optional parameters, the optional component would mean
user has left that option empty if not in use, e.t.c `find expenses d/ morethan/ lessthan/200`. Hence, 
unused parameters are treated a null variables instead.

1. The user types `find expenses d/bruno morethan/30 lessthan/200`. This input is passed through the `Parser`
class from `BudgetBuddy`, which constructs a `FindExpenseCommand` Object with `expenses : current overall ExpenseList`, 
`description : bruno`, `minAmount : 30`, `maxAmount : 200`.
2. `Parser` returns this created `FindExpenseCommand` Object to `BudgetBuddy` and `BudgetBuddy` calls 
`FindExpenseCommand#execute()`
3. `execute()` is called, which initializes a variable `filteredExpenses` of type `ArrayList<Expense>`.
4. `execute()`then calls `ExpenseList#filterexpenses`, which returns the filtered expenses based on the `description`,
`minAmount` and `maxAmount` into the `filteredExpenses` variable.
5.  If `filteredExpenses` is empty, "No Matching Expenses Found" is printed and `execute` ends here.
6. If `filteredExpenses` is not empty, `execute()` then initializes a new variable `filteredExpenseList` 
of type `ExpenseList` with `filteredExpenses` initialized as the `expenses` Class attribute.
7. Finally `execute()` calls `filteredExpenseList#listexpenses()` to print filtered expenses into the CLI.

### Add Expense Feature

#### Implementation

The Add Expense Feature allows users to add expenses to different categories. `AddExpenseCommand` class enables this feature, 
after initialized by the `Parser` class. Within the `AddExpense` object, the `Parser` would have initialized it with
4 variables, an `ExpenseList` object,  along with a `category`, `amount` , `description`. 
The relevance of these Class Attributes in `AddExpenseCommand` is as follows : 

| Class Attribute | Variable Type | Relevance                                         |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| expenses        | ExpenseList   | ExpenseList Object containing the list of expenses|
| category        | String        | The category that the `expense` belongs to        |
| amount          | String        | The amount spent                                  |
| description     | String        | The description of the expense                    |


Upon the call of the `execute()` method in `BudgetBuddy` using `command.execute()`,
the `AddExpenseCommand` Object utilizes the following method from the `ExpenseList` class to add it to the existing
list of `expenses` matching against the corresponding `category`.

| Method       | Return Type | Relevance                                       |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| addExpense() | void        | Add expense to the existing list of `expenses`  |

The following UML Sequence diagram shows how the Parser works to obtain the relevant inputs for the Add Expense Feature :
![Sequence Diagram for Parser for Add Expense Feature](docs\diagram\sequenceDiagram_AddExpense.png)

The following is a step-by-step explanation for the Parser for the Find Feature :
1. `BudgetBuddy` calls `Parser#parseCommand(input)` with `input` being the entire user input.
E.g `add expense c/Transport a/20 d/EZ-Link Top Up`
2. Within the `Parser`, it will have determined that the `input` is a Find Command from the `isAddExpenseCommand(input)`
function. 
3. The `Parser` then self calls the method `handleAddExpenseCommand(input)` with the `input` still being the entire
user input.
4. Within `AddExpenseCommand(input)`, the first check would be the check for the existence of any combination of 
`c/ , a/ and d/`. If none of these combinations were found, it immediately returns `null`. 
5. If the checks in `4.` is passed, Three variables would be initialized.

    * | Variable Name | Variable Type |                                                              
      |---------------|---------------|
      | category      | String        | 
      | a   mount     | String        |
      | description   | String        |
6. Depending on which parameters were present, the corresponding input would be extracted and placed into each variable
using the `Parser#extractDetailsForAdd(input, "parameter")`
7. Finally, `Parser#handleAddExpenseCommand()` returns a `AddExpensesCommand` to `Parser#parseCommand()`, which is
then returned to `BudgetBuddy`
